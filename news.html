      An update of the <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.05470">IBSI 2 reference manual</a> is online (version 5). Changes since the last version are: (i) Updated list of participants; (ii) Clarified the intended use of the "mirror" boundary condition (section 2.2); (iii) The 2D tests in phase 2 are now without interpolation (section 5.2); Moved embedding of convolutional filtering in radiomics workflow to section 1.1; (iv) Added several implementation troubleshooting boxes (chapter 4); (v) Clarified units of sigma and lambda parameters of Gabor filters (section 4.5); (vi) Clarified spatial extent of Gabor filter support (section 4.5); (vii) Clarified implementation of the <i>à trous</i> algorithm (section 4.6.2); (viii) Extended description of non-separable wavelets (section 4.6.4); (ix) Added recommendation to not perform image decomposition beyond the first level using separable wavelets (section 4.6.5); (x) Extended description of the Riesz transform (section 4.7); and (xi) Removed chapter 5 <i>Filtering for Radiomics in Practice</i>.
